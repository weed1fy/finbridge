FINBRIDGE — PSX-Only Stock Screener (Replit AI Build Spec)
0. Non-Negotiables

Exchange scope: PSX only. Do not reference or fetch from NYSE or yfinance anywhere.

Universe: Dynamically import the top 300 PSX stocks (by market cap or turnover) and keep the list fresh. (described in documentation pasted & the python scrapper )

Currency: PKR everywhere.

Data sources: web scrapping from the given code & its explanation stockanalysis.com 

Realtime feel: Smart polling with stale-while-revalidate caching; no hard page reloads.

1. Purpose

Deliver an investor-grade PSX stock screener that filters equities by financial indicators and risk appetite (low/medium/high), returning a shortlist and CAPM expected returns beside each result.

2. Core Functionality

Investor Input (Filters)

UI exposes adjustable ranges for indicators (min/max): Earnings Yield, ROE, Asset Turnover, Leverage, Dividend Yield, Net Margin, P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, 1Y/3Y TSR, Beta, etc.

“Preset risk” chips: Low / Medium / High auto-preload sensible brackets; users can fine-tune.

Algorithmic Filtering

Apply selected ranges to the top-300 PSX universe.

Return a ranked shortlist aligned to the selected risk profile (see risk model below).

Risk Profiling

Map stocks into Low / Medium / High bands using indicator brackets (e.g., Low-risk: higher ROE/dividend, lower beta/leverage/volatility; High-risk: inverse). Make brackets configurable in a JSON policy.

Expected Return (CAPM)

)

Rf: Pakistan 3M or 6M T-bill proxy (config value).

Rm: Config market return (e.g., PSX KSE-100 expected return).

βi: Estimated from scraped historical price series vs. index; if not feasible, approximate from volatility class + sector beta mapping (fallback).

3. Data Strategy (PSX-only)

Universe ingestion :



Per-company data:

Scraping using python code is attached

Realtime/last price, change, volume

Fundamentals (P/E, P/B, dividend yield), ratios (ROE, asset turnover, leverage), corporate actions where present

Parse tables/labels into normalized schema.

Historical time series (for chart + beta):

If DPS exposes historical prices per company, scrape paginated history. If not present, use another PSX-official endpoint/page only (still PSX scope). If historical is unavailable, compute beta using short-window price deltas available or fall back to sector beta mapping.

Technical indicators (computed locally):

SMA(20/50/200), EMA(12/26), RSI(14), MACD(12,26,9), ATR(14), 52-week high/low flags.

Resilience & Compliance:

Use Playwright (headless) for dynamic content, Cheerio for parsing static HTML.

Implement ETag/If-Modified-Since, randomized backoff, and server-side cache (Redis or file-cache) with TTLs:

Quotes: 30–60s

Ratios/fundamentals: 12–24h

Universe list: 24h

Configurable User-Agent and polite crawl delay.

4. UI/UX (Apple-style Brief)

Look & feel: Clean white canvas, subtle light-gray dividers, Apple Blue #4A90E2 for primary CTAs, pro gray text hierarchy, soft shadows, 12px corner radius.

Glass effects: Refined backdrop blur on nav and key cards; thin overlay borders; gentle elevation.

Animations:

Apple-like cubic-bezier easing; hover lift ~2px; subtle scale on buttons.

Micro-interactions on filter sliders, chips, and cards.

Typography: Inter + Apple system stack; enable ligatures; clear weight hierarchy for financial metrics.

Pages (separate routes):

Landing (marketing)

Live PSX market preview widgets (animated cards)

Rotating stats, “How it works,” testimonials (portfolio managers/advisors), feature grids

High-signal CTAs with blue gradient

Comprehensive footer (product, legal, contact)

Screener (main app)

Left: filter rail (collapsible) with presets + advanced indicators

Top: search, sort, saved screens, risk chips

Grid of stock cards (clean white) with key KPIs, tags (risk band, dividend, momentum)

Stock Detail

Polylined interactive price graph (intraday/daily toggle), indicators overlays (SMA/EMA/RSI)

Fundamentals, ratios, dividends, corporate actions

CAPM tile with inputs and E(Ri)

Peer comparison and related ideas

Interactions:

Clicking a stock opens detail page (deep link).

Hover reveals micro-metrics; click-through maintains filter state.

Filters drive instant shortlist (debounced).

5. Tech Stack (Replit-friendly)

Frontend: React + Vite, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion for micro-animations, Recharts (or visx) for charts.

Design system: Utility-first with custom Tailwind theme (color tokens, 12px rounding, shadows).

Backend: Node.js (Express/Fastify).

Scraping: Playwright + Cheerio.

State: React Query (SWR) for data fetching, optimistic UI + SWR revalidate.

Cache: In-memory + optional Redis (if enabled in Replit).

Typing: TypeScript end-to-end.

6. Data Model (Key Entities)
type IndicatorSet = {
  pe?: number; pb?: number; evEbitda?: number;
  earningsYield?: number; roe?: number; assetTurnover?: number;
  leverage?: number; dividendYield?: number; netMargin?: number;
  rsi14?: number; sma20?: number; sma50?: number; sma200?: number;
  beta?: number; volatility30d?: number; tsr1y?: number; tsr3y?: number;
};

type Stock = {
  ticker: string; name: string; sector?: string;
  currency: "PKR";
  lastPrice: number; changePct?: number; volume?: number; updatedAt: string;
  indicators: IndicatorSet;
  riskBand: "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH";
};

type UniverseSnapshot = {
  asOf: string;
  criteria: "marketCap" | "turnover";
  stocks: Stock[];
};

7. Risk Model (Config-Driven)

Provide /config/risk-bands.json with min/max for key indicators per band.

Compute riskBand per stock after indicators are populated.

Allow user presets to override min/max ranges in the Screener UI.

8. Filters (Schwab-style Depth, PSX Data)

Quick filters: Dividend payers, Low beta, Value (low P/E, low P/B), Quality (high ROE), Momentum (TSR/RSI), Income (high DY), Size (large-cap).

Advanced: Numeric sliders for each indicator; sector multi-select; exclude illiquid (min volume).

Persistence: URL-based query params + local saved screens.

9. Realtime & Performance

SWR strategy: Return cached immediately; revalidate in background; push updated cards.

Quotes polling: 30–60s with jitter; stop when tab inactive.

Server aggregation: Batch scrape; hydrate frontend via a single /api/screener payload.

10. Security & Ops

Rotate scraper headers; handle 429s with backoff.

Validate and sanitize all responses.

Feature-flag headless scraping vs. static parsing.

Log scrape errors per-ticker; degrade gracefully (show last good data + timestamp).

11. Deliverables

Complete multi-page app (Landing, Screener, Stock Detail) matching the Apple-style spec.

Working scraper for PSX DPS, assembling top-100 universe and indicators.

CAPM module with configurable Rf and Rm.

Interactive polyline chart with indicators.

End-to-end filtering that precisely shortlists PSX stocks per user inputs.

PKR-only UI, professional micro-animations, hover states, and glass effects.

12. Acceptance Criteria

No references to NYSE/yfinance/US symbols anywhere.

Top-300 PSX list loads and is visible; filters narrow results accurately.

Clicking a stock opens its detail page with working chart, metrics, and CAPM tile.

Landing page is engaging, not bare: live preview cards, feature sections, testimonials, CTAs, robust footer.

All prices and amounts in PKR; time labels localized.

Data refresh without full page reload; stale-while-revalidate implemented.

13. Implementation Hints (Optional)




Frontend: Tailwind theme with #4A90E2 primary, soft shadows, 12px radii, glass header; Framer Motion for 2px hover lift.

Make me this stock screener with Proper nice Ui & filter and there sub filters as mentioned in first txt file ive attached (prompt) and the 2nd file ive attached is of filters & there sub filters explained as excel so make sure to veiw that too to make all filters & there functionality accordingly having all filters defined with all algos and everything, its a key excel file mentioned every filter there subfilter & criterias which we can add accordingly

basically client wants an stock screener like Charles Schwab but for Pakistan stock exchange so make that with proper ui & everything realtime + working no flaw

the 1st file is prompt, 2nd file is excel file containing all the filter & sub filter details explaining it criteria, then the 3rd file is one of the key files as it is of python which holds the code we will use to scrape & get real time date from the stockanalysis website then the data scrapped is sent to a json file which name should be psx_top300.json which is also 4th file, i ran the python locally and the json output file i pasted for ur ease and the last and 5th file holds proper documentation for u to integrate this scrapping easily this should give us real time data & changes whenever user refreshes app, it should not be slow and like show 20 stocks per page distributing all 300 accross the site, this site has to be flawless & according to my needs please integrate real time data i even code a whole scrapper just use it and make me the site with working filters mentioned in excel file, filters like charles schwab, lets get it production ready !!

Basically the scraper in python file i gave u work lik it first fetches top 300 stocks from stockanalysis site then one by one runs there appropirate urls to fetch data from each doing it for all 300 and when it gets all 300/300 done it saves in the psx_top300.json, which must be present in same directory , but this process is kind of slow and displayes in terminal that its done fetching xyz stock & all , so to handle user we can do on front end like making a dynamic loading showing 1/300 stocks loaded changing it dynamcally so user does not think that he is stuck , make this working use same scrapper & all just get it done make a landing page with proper nice professional ui, the major problem that can occur is of data not loading so keep an extra focus on that check again & again till finalizing to make it perfect, with all filters user friendly working perfect

it must be like runs scraper runs everytime user visits website to get fresh stocks not the old ahh data from same json , make it working & dynamic

so basically i want a working & presentable stock screener with all the info proper stock loading system showing how many stocks loaded how many left & eeverything and a proper about us section like everything ready to be done add images too in website make it nice make it best with proper Ui & functionality

the txt 1 ive pasted is the documentation for the Scraper we will use & the docx ive pasted after that is for all website text content so use that in about me & landing pages and everything and the excel after that has pre made indicators and everything to make filters work nicely and amazingly to fill in gaps for the stock whose data isnt being loaded and the python file ive given is main backbone its the scraper which will scrape all 300 stocks from the psx and last image is of graph i want to represent somewhere in graph



please make it with nice UI and for stock screener all the filters should be from the above raw excel i gave u first and properly working no flaw also the loading system must be proper with nice error handling & all proper refresh functionality and all 

the stock details page must be showing graph & all and for the missing feilds instead of showing N/A use the data from excel ive pasted and gave u raw form in text too or just show nothing but dont show N/A it will look website is lacking information so yeah

our main function is of filtering and stock short listing so make sure the filters are proper and user friendly working and shortlisting stocks in nice way make website professional use related images in landing page nice animations and evertyhing lets launch it for public use!!
